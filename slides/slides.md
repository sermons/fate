# Opening **Question**

[###](#/outline "secret")

---
But all this I laid to heart, examining it all, <br>
how the righteous and the wise <br>
and their deeds are in the hand of God.

Whether it is love or hate,<br>
man does not know; both are before him.

---
2
It is the same for all, since the same event <br>
happens to the righteous and the wicked, <br>
to the good and the evil, to the clean and the unclean, <br>
to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice.

As the good one is, so is the sinner, <br>
and he who swears is as he who shuns an oath.

---
3
This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, <br>
that the same event happens to all.

Also, the hearts of the children of man are full of evil,<br>
and madness is in their hearts while they live, <br>
and after that they go to the dead.

---
4
But he who is joined with all the living has hope, <br>
for a living dog is better than a dead lion.

5
For the living know that they will die, <br>
but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward,<br>
for the memory of them is forgotten.

---
6
Their love and their hate and their envy <br>
have already perished,

and forever they have no more share <br>
in all that is done under the sun.

---
7
Go, eat your bread with joy, <br>
and drink your wine with a merry heart, <br>
for God has already approved what you do.

8
Let your garments be always white. <br>
Let not oil be lacking on your head.

---
9
Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, <br>
all the days of your vain life <br>
that he has given you under the sun,

because that is your portion in life <br>
and in your toil at which you toil under the sun.

---
10
Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might,

for there is no work or thought or knowledge <br>
or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.
