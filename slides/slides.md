But all this I laid to heart, examining it all, <br>
how the righteous and the wise <br>
and their deeds are in the hand of God.

It is the same for all, since the same event <br>
happens to the righteous and the wicked,

[Ecclesiastes 9:1a,2a (ESV) (p.1/5)](# "ref")

******
Also, the hearts of the children of man <br>
are full of evil,<br>
and madness is in their hearts while they live, <br>
and after that they go to the dead.

[Ecclesiastes 9:3 (ESV) (p.2/5)](# "ref")

******
[4](# "ref")
But he who is joined with all the living <br>
has hope, <br>
for a living dog is better than a dead lion.

[5](# "ref")
For the living know that they will die, <br>
but the dead know nothing, <br>
and they have no more reward,<br>
for the memory of them is forgotten.

[Ecclesiastes 9:4-5 (ESV) (p.3/5)](# "ref")

******
[9](# "ref")
Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, <br>
all the days of your vain life <br>
that he has given you under the sun,

because that is your portion in life <br>
and in your toil at which you toil under the sun.

[Ecclesiastes 9:9 (ESV) (p.4/5)](# "ref")

******
[10](# "ref")
Whatever your hand finds to do, <br>
do it with your might,

for there is no work or thought or knowledge <br>
or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.
